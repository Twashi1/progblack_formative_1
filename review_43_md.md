# Practical review

 

## General Comments:

- Interesting content

- Doesn't have a fully cohesive design

- Some pages aren't very detailed

- Varying quality of written presentation

- Varying quality of visual presentation

- Sufficient evidence of collaboration

- Edits at the last minute (forgivable because consistent commits throughout the project)

 

# Interest of content - very good
    Content is often unexpected and thus interesting. There is often not much in depths discussion which could be useful to make it more interesting.

# Consistency and quality of visual representation - good
    A lot of variance and intersting features that keep it exciting. A lack of overall consistancy with some pages being different colours, different sizing of nav bar, very different layouts etc...

# Quality of written presentation - good
    A lot of variance in the length of the topics discussed, and also the quality in terms of punctuation and readability.

# Evidence of collaboration: 

# Author info - perfect 

# Balanced contribution - Good 
  Commits heavily weighted towards Twashi, however everyone seemed to contribute similar amounts within their indvidual webpages

# Not completed at the last minute - good 

 

**Overall: good**
